# Tender-recommendational-system
This simple recommendation system recommends suppliers to a customer based on the history of their partnership and the similarity between the tender and the supplier's characteristics. The project is mainly aimed at demonstrating my hard skills, rather than knowledge and insight into how tenders work in detail.

Sorry, but no data! All the data used in the project is real and too specific to be published.
